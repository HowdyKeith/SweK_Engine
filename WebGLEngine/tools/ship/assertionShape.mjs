// tools/ship/assertionShape.mjs -- v4480
//
// *** THE TREE'S MOST-USED ASSERTION HAS 1,489 INDEPENDENT COPIES, 38 DISTINCT DEFINITIONS, TWO INCOMPATIBLE
// SIGNATURES AND NO OWNER. *** 1,497 of 1,518 gates call `ok(...)`. 1,489 of them DEFINE it, in their own file,
// a few lines from the top. ZERO import one. So when v4479 said its repair -- a signature that refuses a
// function -- "belongs to whichever round owns the helper", that sentence had no referent. Nothing owns it,
// and a defect in it cannot be fixed once.
//
// ---- *** WHY THAT MATTERS, AND IT IS NOT TIDINESS *** --------------------------------------------------------
//
// `ok(name, condition)` takes ANY value in the condition slot. A function is a value. A promise is a value. A
// non-empty string is a value, and every one of them is truthy, so a check written in any of those shapes
// prints PASS with the code under it completely broken. This session wrote it THREE TIMES in three rounds --
// `ok(name, async () => true)` at v4478, and at v4479 both `ok(name, (() => true)())` and
// `ok(name, async () => {...}())`, the last handing `ok` a promise. All three were caught by reading, not by
// running, which is the part worth being uncomfortable about: nothing in a tree of fifteen hundred gates
// would have said a word.
//
// And the two signatures make a fourth shape possible. 1,439 gates spell it `ok(name, cond, detail)`; 78
// spell it `ok(cond, message)`, condition FIRST. A line pasted from a majority gate into one of those 78
// reads `ok("some message", cond)` -- and the message is a non-empty string, so it ALWAYS PASSES.
// (16 more gates spell it in a shape this classifier will not guess at, and are reported `unknown`
// rather than folded into either camp -- a census that resolves its own ambiguity by picking is
// a census with a thumb on it.)
//
// ---- *** WHAT THE SWEEP FOUND TODAY, WHICH IS NOTHING, AND WHY THAT IS REPORTED RATHER THAN BURIED *** -------
//
//     gates                                              1518
//     calling ok()                                       1497
//     defining their own ok()                            1489   (importing one: 0)
//     distinct definitions                                 38
//     condition-first signatures                           78
//     call sites with a function in the condition slot       0
//     call sites with an un-awaited async IIFE               0
//     condition-first calls passing a string first           0
//
// Every hazard this file describes is currently un-fired. That is a real result and it is the reason the
// positive controls in the gate are not optional: a detector that has only ever returned zero is
// indistinguishable from a detector that cannot return anything else, and this tree has caught that shape five
// times this session alone. Each of the three finders is therefore driven against a fixture built to trip it,
// and the zero above means something only because of that.
//
// ---- *** WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM *** ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// That it finds every way a non-boolean reaches the condition slot. It reads SOURCE TEXT and finds three
// shapes it can name: an arrow that is never invoked, an async IIFE that is never awaited, and a string
// literal where a condition-first signature expects the condition. `ok(name, someHelper())` returning a
// promise from a named function is INVISIBLE to it, and so is anything computed into a variable first. The
// three it finds are the three this session actually wrote, which is a reason to trust the shapes and not the
// coverage.
//
// That consolidating the 1,489 copies is proposed here. It is not: rewriting the assertion in every gate in
// the tree is a change to fifteen hundred files whose only test is the gates themselves, and the census is
// what an argument for doing it would have to start from. This round measures and detects; it does not
// consolidate, and the number is left on the page for the round that wants to.
